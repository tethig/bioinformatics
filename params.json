Notepad (on Windows) or TextEdit (on Mac) tend to correct spelling. This is **not** something we want when handling sequences.\r\n\r\nIf you are using an NTU PC, I recommend launching an instance of \"Notepad++\" via NTU's Software Centre (icon on Desktop). If you are using your own PC you can get it [here](https://notepad-plus-plus.org). On MacOS I recommend [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/). For the programmers among you (any OS) try [Atom](https://atom.io).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Links to Content\r\nPlease follow the links below to the appropriate class:\r\n\r\n| Workshop # | Workshop Title & Link                            |\r\n|:----------:|:------------------------------------------------:|\r\n| 1          | BLAST Searching (on NOW only)                    |\r\n| 2          | [Sequence Retrieval & Alignment](aligntree.html) |\r\n| 3          | [Genome Browsers](genbrowse.html)                |",
